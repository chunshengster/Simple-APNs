Simple-Apns is a simple apple notification server for your own apple app use!

You can just config the "config/config.ini" file then put your ssl key file(like key.pem and cert.pem)
 into some directorys where this script have priviledge to access

Then type "python SimpleApns.py start" in the console, so ,it's so simple ÔºÅ
  certainly you must config Q4M first :)
